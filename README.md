# SAP Security Maturity Model

<img src="img/Silverback.png" width="150"/><br>


The CBAS - SAP Security Maturity Model (CBAS-SSMM) project allows organizations to determine their SAP security posture based on controls that are used to define a maturity level that organizations can maintain or adapt to. This enables organizations to plan and enhance their security mechanisms when protecting SAP resources.


## Whats In It For Me (WIIFM)

The project is intended to be used by different professionals:

- SAP Security Experts
- non-SAP Security Experts
- Consultants
- Auditors
- Advisors

The project helps teams assess, plan, and verify security controls that affect SAP implementations in their organizations.

- Excel tool to present maturity levels, risk areas represented by the [NO MONKEY Security Matrix](NMSM.md), and implementation status
