# SAP Security Maturity Model

<img src="img/Silverback.png" width="150"/><br>


The CBAS - SAP Security Maturity Model (CBAS-SSMM) project allows organizations to determine their SAP security posture based on controls that are used to define a maturity level that organizations can maintain or adapt to. This enables organizations to plan and enhance their security mechanisms when protecting SAP resources.


## Whats In It For Me (WIIFM)

The project intends to be used by different professionals:

- SAP Security Experts
- non-SAP Security Experts
- Consultants
- Auditors
- Advisors

The project helps teams assess, plan, and verify security controls that affect SAP implementations in their organizations.

## Maturity Levels

We follow different methodologies and standards to define the different controls for each maturity level.

In our initial release, and for defining maturity level 1, we want to create a security baseline every organization MUST maintain to secure SAP applications.

#### Maturity level 1:

The first maturity level is the initial baseline and is derived from the below standards:

- SAP Security Baseline Template V2.1
- German Federal Office for Information Security - BSI 4.2 SAP ERP System
- German Federal Office for Information Security - BSI 4.6 SAP ABAP Programming
- SAP security white papers - used for critical areas missing in the security baseline template and BSI standards

#### Maturity level 2:

#### Maturity level 3:



## Controls

We aim to create controls in a structured, easy, and understandable way.

- Every control follows the same identification schema and structure
- Markdown language used for presenting the controls
- Excel tool to present maturity levels, risk areas represented by the [NO MONKEY Security Matrix](NMSM.md), and implementation status

#### Control Header:

- NIST Security Function
- NIST Category
- [IPAC Model](NMSM.md)
- SAP Technology
- Maturity Level
- Defender (People, Process, Technology)
- Control Prerequisite

#### Control Structure:

- Description of the control
- Implementing the control
- Verification of the control
- References
