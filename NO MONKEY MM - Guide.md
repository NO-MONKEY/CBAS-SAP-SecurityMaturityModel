## Guide:
---
Every metric/control within the NO MONKEY Maturity Model should be defined clearly. All metrics/controls follow the below structure:


    I. Security Function (IY, PT, DT, RD, RR)
      i. Category
        1. IPAC
          a. Maturity Level
            1.a. Defender (PPT)
---
In each metric/control the following sections should be available:

    1. Description of the metric/controls
    2. Implementing the metric/control across the three lines of defense
    3. Identifying or proving the metric exists against the three lines of defense
    4. References that can extend the control to the entire cuber security strategy

### Maturity levels:

Maturity levels are described below:

|Maturity level|Standards Applicability|Additional Information|
|:-------------:|:---------------------|:---------------------|
|1| SAP Standard & BSI||
|2|


A control can have four different states:
1. Implemented
2. Implemented and maintained
3. Implemented, maintained, and monitored
4. Implemented, maintained, monitored and reviewed
5. Not implemented

These states verifies and supports organizations in building an appropriate strategy around the different controls that affect core business applications.

Each state covers a value of risk that a specific control may have on an organization.

Controls are valued by their maturity and risk level. Controls are given a pre-defined risk and maturity level. *verify if this works*

- Maturity of a control is defined by the below formula:
> MC = Risk level * Implementation status score ( * > does not represent multiplication )

- For each NIST CS function a risk score is calculated
  - For more detailed risk analysis, a risk score can be calculated by each category used
- For each IPAC model a risk score is calculated within each NIST CS function
- Show number of protection controls per element (People, Process, Technology)

- To determine a companies maturity level the below formula is used:
> ML = Overall risk * Industry criticality
> - Industry criticality is taken from different criteria's

### NO MONKEY ADVISORY Internal:

This sections illustrates the roadmap in which to support organizations wanting to enhance their maturity level:

> Initial engagement: Report card that illustrates the current maturity level of the organization. The report card includes the below sections:
  - Current maturity level
  - Deriving an acceptable maturity level based on certain criteria's defined for a specific industry
  - Graphic representation of the security function against the NO MONKEY Security Matrix
  - Gap areas between the three lines of defense
  - The applicability of baselines, standards, and methodologies within the organization
  - Representation of the high risk areas (based on the security functions)
  - Scope of the initial engagement

*Identify how to derive each area of the report card*

Depending on the scope identified in the initial engagement, further services are presented to the customer that allows the organization to reach an acceptable maturity level.

> Services can include but not limited to:
  - Code Security Review
  - Network Security Infrastructure Concept Review
  - SAP Security Assessment
  - SAP SDLC Security Evaluation Review
  - SAP Penetration Testing
